Factorial of a number

Counts number of words in a given input string
Counts number of lines in a given input string

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead
of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both
three and five print "FizzBuzz". This is famously known as the FizzBuzz test.

Print out the fibonacci sequence less than 30

Retuns true if the input string is a substring of any
day of the week. ie; Strings like SAT, satur, Saturday

Get elapsed time between two times
elapsed("12:20:32", "12:21:03") --> 31

Given a string like, "1, 3-7, 12, 15, 18-21", produce the list
[1,3,4,5,6,7,12,15,18,19,20,21]

Add two list without duplicates
Collatz sequence
  1. Start with an arbitrary (positive) integer.
  2. If the number is even, divide by 2; if the number is odd multiply by 3 and add 1.
  3. Repeat the procedure with the new number.
  4. There is a cycle of 4, 2, 1 at which the procedure loops.

Count word frequencies in a given string. The result should be
stored in a dictionary

Given a string, get a string with vowels only.
vowels('Hello') --> 'eo'


Write a program to find Primitive Pythagorean Triads A pythagorean triad
has the property. By primitive we mean triads that do not ‘depend’ on others. For example,
(4,3,5) is a variant of (3,4,5) and hence is not primitive. And (10,24,26) is easily derived from
(5,12,13) and should not be displayed by our program. Write a program to print primitive
pythagorean triads. The program should generate all triads with a, b values in the range 0—100


Given a string of the form "4-7, 9, 12, 15" find the numbers missing in this list for a given range.
